title: 'Content Rules: Real People'
---

As our community grows, we're committed to keeping it an enjoyable and respectful space for everyone. A place where we can harness the power of AI, while ensuring everyone's privacy and consent are respected. To this end, we've been refining our guidelines regarding the use of resources depicting real people.

## Depicting Real People

Content that depicts, or is based on the likeness of real people - living or deceased - including public figures, celebrities, influencers, and private individuals, is strictly prohibited.

## FAQs

### Q: How are these guidelines enforced?

**A:** Every image uploaded to Civitai is automatically scanned using AI tagging systems that flag content for moderation. If content is suspected of violating our policies - especially those relating to the depiction of real individuals - it’s sent to a human moderator for review. While our AI is constantly improving, it’s not perfect. If you see something that looks like a real person, report it. Community vigilance plays a huge part in maintaining a respectful space.

### Q: How can I report content that I believe violates the community guidelines?

**A:** Images and models have a “Report” option in their menu. If you don’t see it or need help, just head to our Discord server and flag it to a moderator. We genuinely appreciate your help in keeping this space safe and rule-abiding.

### Q: Why are you so strict about this?

**A:** Using someone’s likeness without their consent is a serious matter, and we’re drawing a hard line to protect individuals’ rights and to future-proof the platform. Real people - celebrities, influencers, private individuals, anyone - are off limits.

### Q: I've used a person's name in my prompt, but the image doesn't resemble them. Is that okay?

**A:** We care about results, not just prompts. If the image doesn't resemble the real person in any meaningful way - visually or stylistically - it’s fine. However! Prompting for celebrity names will produce warnings in the generator, and if unheeded, your account will be sent for review.

### Q: What if my resource is of an adult performer, who regularly appears in more revealing clothing?

**A:** Consent to appear in one context (like film) doesn’t equal blanket permission for AI generation. If the model or image resembles a known individual, it’s not allowed.

### Q: My resource is meant to depict a character, like Jack Reacher, but it's trained on Tom Cruise and Alan Ritchson. Is this permitted?

**A:** If the output resembles Tom Cruise (or any other real person), it’s not allowed. You’ll need to retrain using content that doesn’t lean on real-world faces.

### Q: Can I use historical figures in my AI models?

**A:** No. This policy applies across the board. Even if someone’s been dead for centuries, if they were a real human being, they’re off limits for depiction.

### Q: What about using images of fictional characters played by real actors?

**A:** If the image obviously resembles the actor behind the role, it violates the policy.

### Q: I am the real person or a legal representitive of the real person displayed in images found on Civitai.

**A:** If you find an image or resource depicting your likeness you can report it via the "flag" icon available on every image and model, or by filling out **[this form](/content/likeness-claim-request)**, or by emailing us at digital-likeness@civitai.com

### Q: Are there any restrictions on using AI to create child-like models?

**A:** Models intended for the photo-realistic depiction of minors are prohibited. You can read more about our requirements for content depicting minors [here](/content/rules/minors)

### Q: What happens if someone repeatedly violates the community guidelines?

**A:** We take violations of our community guidelines seriously. Users who repeatedly fail to comply with our guidelines may face sanctions, such as content removal, account suspension, or permanent ban.

### Q: Can I provide feedback or suggest changes to the community guidelines?

**A:** Of course! We value your input. After all, this community is like a potluck – everyone brings something to the table. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines or have spotted something we might have missed, please let us know by <a href="https://feedback.civitai.com/" target="_blank">submitting feedback</a>.
